<p>I was born in Augusta, Georgia to Mike and Jane Marie Wilson. At the time my dad was in residency and my mom was trying to work and raise me. My sister was born a year later, almost to the day (1 year and 6 hours after me) in Gainesville, Florida. Shortly after her birth, our family moved back to Georgia and I have lived in the state ever since. 
I lived most of the younger years of my life in Athens, GA. I went to Athens Academy until 4th grade when our family moved to Dalton, GA - where my parents still live today. 
</p>
<p>
In high school I played football, tennis, and club soccer. I also developed an interest in electronics mainly through an Engineering class. (When I was in high school, our school required us to designate a "pathway" that we had to stay in for all years through school. Most people picked chorus or an easy art class, but I chose Engineering.) 
In the Enginnering class, we were priviledged to work with everything from industrial robotics and 3D milling machines to programmable, remote controlled robots and complex drafting CAD programs. Our senior project was to design a semi-autonomous "submarine" that could retrieve varying objects off the bottom of the pool. 
</p>
<p>
I graduated in May 2012 and began classes at UGA that fall. Coming out of highschool I thought I may want to be an engineer. However, my first semester had a lot of study-intensive classes and I wasn't prepared (to check out any classes I've previously taken, visit the "<a href="schedules.html">Class Schedules</a>" tab. This led to a few changes in major but now I am a Finance major but after taking a computer science class, I am interested in pursuing a second major in computer science. 
</p>
<p>
The biggest hobbies I currently have are sport shooting (mostly shotguns with clay, trap, and I dabbled in competition) and just shooting other guns for fun with the family. I enojy hunting but haven't been able to go as much as I would like to due to limited availability of time becuase of school. I also really enjoy SCUBA diving - I have my dad to thank for that, we frequently chose vacation spots based on diving activity. Check out the "<a href="pictures.html">Pictures</a>"" tab for some cool photos of us diving. He first got me started in it and I ran with it. I am currently a PADI certified Divemaster and have looked into becoming an instructor or even working through the Ramsey center at UGA. I also like playing all sports, although there's some I'm better at than others, but I'm very competitive and do not like to lose. A couple years ago I was big into HTML but I haven't kept up with the advancements made, so coding with CSS + HTML is new to me, but after getting the hang of it I'm starting to like it. 
</p>
<p>If you took the time to read this all the way through, thanks you and I'd like to say I tried to keep it short while still hitting the high parts I wanted to share. But don't fret, the rest of the site is much more concise! Thanks for stopping by!
