CircularLinkedList for some reason doesn't add in sorted order.. although we logically tried to implement a sorted list. If you 
		   look at the code you will see that we use CompareTo and attempt to put the numbers in the list in order..
		   but for some reason it just doesn't do it

DoublyLinkedList : I can't get it to accept any more than 2 list items without crashing.. I have been working on moving the
		 pointers  and checking that theyre not null but somehow it always crashes. It'll read the first 2 values but most
		 likely crash after that. Becuase of this, I can't really debug any other errors

I'm not really proud of it, but don't see myself figuring out the problem before the deadline
