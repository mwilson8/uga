*	Purpose: This program is designed to compute the amount of money a
*  	person would owe, given the items they purchased from a menu list.
*  	The prices of the items are multiplied by the user's "shopping list"
*  	to compute the pre-tax amount owed. Tax is then added and both values
*  	are displayed.
