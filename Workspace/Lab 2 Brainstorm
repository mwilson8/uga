		** note **
		the variables expressed here may or may not match the variables in the final code

Objectives:
	1. compute gross pay
	2. compute all taxes & deductions
	3. compute net pay

Solutions:
	1. hoursWorked * wageRate = grossPay
	2. 
		a) grossPay * taxRate1 = deduction1
		b) grossPay * taxRate2 = deduction2
		c) grossPAy * taxRate3 = deduction3
		....
	3. grossPay - sum (2a:2n) = netPay

	4. Output grossPay, deductions 1-n, & netPay

Notes:
	* most variables will probably have to be doubles --> money uses decimal places
	* hours could be an int or a double (since all other variables will be doubles, output values will 	
		have to be doubles anyways)
	* should make all tax rates 'final'
	* need to use Scanner to have input of hours

	To start in the code, I'm going to import the scanner class and then initialize all tax rates to be final. All calculations are simple, but I'll write them in a commented out section to be sure. 
	First interaction with the user will be a out.print of "Hours per week:" and that will store to 'hoursPerWeek'. Next, all calculations will be done, storing to their appropriate variables: grossPay, federalTax, stateTax, ss_Tax, medTax.
	Then all deductions will be subtracted from grossPay to get netPay.
	Interaction with the user will then be a bunch of out.println and a combination of words, variables, and tab '\t' which I'll play with until it looks to my liking.
