*	Purpose: This program is designed as a first introduction to arrays.
*				Its purpose is to ask the user for a definite amount of
*				numbers, a starting value, and an increment value. From
*				there, the program populates 2 arrays. The first is X
*				values based on the user's input. The seccond is Y values
*				which are calculated by running a formula over the first 
*				array. After both arrays are populated, a horizontal graph
*				is created using the y-value array. 
*

* Statement of Academic Honesty: *
* The following code represents my own work. I have neither
* received nor given inappropriate assistance. I have not copied
* or modified code from any source other than the course webpage
* or the course textbook. I recognize that any unauthorized
* assistance or plagiarism will be handled in accordance with
* the University of Georgia's Academic Honesty Policy and the
* policies of this course. I recognize that my work is based
* on an assignment created by the Department of Computer
* Science at the University of Georgia. Any publishing
* or posting of source code for this project is strictly
