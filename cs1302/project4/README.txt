All the java files are in the package "edu.uga.cs1302.mp3files" and will need to be compiled as such. 
The main method for the MP3 Project is the file MyMP3Files.java and it is in the default package.
The main method for the JUnit tester is SimpleArrayListTester.java 

In order to properly execute the MP3 project, you will need to ensure that there are 3 .jar files on the classpath:
	1) jl1.0.1.jar
	2) mp3spi1.9.5.jar
	3) tritonus_shar.jar

In order to properly execute the JUnit tester, the following .jar files must be on the classpath:
	1) hamcrest-core-1.3.jar
	2) junit-4.12.jar

The accompanying javadoc documents are also in the project directory
