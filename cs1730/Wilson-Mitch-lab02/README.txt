Reflection:
Due to a section change that was processed, I didn't get to attend lab last week so I didn't submit a brainstorm. However, I did briefly discuss the project with a friend who is in the lab. What we discussed and what ended as the final product was very similar. I didn't account for some of the functions that I had to use, simply because I didn't know about them.
A couple of google searches and a little browsing on cplusplus.com & stackoverflow.com helped figure out the parts that weren't originally working for me
