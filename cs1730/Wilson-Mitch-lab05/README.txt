Reflection:
Spent a lot of time staring at my screen just hoping it would work if I kept doing the same thing..
Trying to read the documentation on ncurses (or lack thereof) after being accustomed to the Java API and C++ is a bear
I took an extra day to try to get it to work and got so frustrated that I'm just going to start all over, someone mentioned trying to use scroll pad so I'll probably try that next. 
Anyways, this is essentially just the same code from lab 4 because I deleted pretty much everything from failed attempts from lab 5 and then realized I should probably turn something in today
