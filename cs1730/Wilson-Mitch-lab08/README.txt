reflection:
I just spent 5 minutes wondering why I couldn't open my source file before I realized I wasn't giving the emacs
command. I thought it would be simple, with a few if statements and a loop or two reading & printing to 
STDFILENOs. However, it makes sense in my head but I can't make it work. Tired and frustrated.
