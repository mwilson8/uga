project 1

To compile the program:
$ make

To run:
$ ./p1

To remove old compiled files & executables:
$ make clean


Reflection:
This was harder than expected. Not from a logic standpoint, but more so with the tiny differences in syntax that 
were causing problems a lot. Once I figured out the syntax, the rest of the program fell into place
