NOTES:
At some point during development, the 'exit' built-in stopped agreeing with us\
we've messed with it a lot and it has something to do with ignoring/defaulting signals\
but we can't seem to figure it out. 


!!***running '$ exit' in our shell will log you off of the cluster/nike***!!


however, '$ exit 35' will exit the shell with exit value 35, like it's supposed to...it's weird
